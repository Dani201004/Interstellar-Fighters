# Interstellar-Fighters
Video game designed and developed solely by me while I was studying for the Advanced Vocational Degree in 3D Animation, Games, and Interactive Environments. It is a simple space shooter for one or two players, where you must destroy enemy ships and asteroids in order to survive.
